# Reverse Proxy with NGINX

NGINX is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache. The software was created by Igor Sysoev and publicly released in 2004. Nginx is free and open-source software, released under the terms of the 2-clause BSD license. A large fraction of web servers use NGINX, often as a load balancer.

## Installing

Before we proceed installing the NGINX package, make sure you that everything is up to date:

```
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Next, we'll install Apache:

```
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

#### Creating a new VirtualHost

VirtualHosts allows you to run multiple website on a single web server (website1.com, website2.com, etc..) this is useful especially if you are also hosting other web services such as a website or store front.

Access NGINX's VirtualHost directory:

```
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
```

Create a new file with the name being the domain that you will use, be aware that the file name must end with ".conf".

```
sudo touch {DOMAIN_NAME}.conf 
```

For example, let's say that our fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is **cool.app** and that we want to use the subdomain **feedbacky**, the correct format will look like this:

```
sudo touch feedbacky.cool.conf 
```

Edit your newly made VirtualHost file and paste the configuration below:

{% hint style="info" %}
TIP: When creating a file you can directly skip having to use `touch` by instead using `nano`, it will create the new file for you and let you edit it at the same time.
{% endhint %}

```
server {
      listen 80;
      server_name {DOMAIN_NAME};

      location / {
        proxy_pass http://{SERVER_IP}:{CLIENT_APP_PORT}:
      }
}
```

|                     |                                                                     |   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | - |
| `{DOMAIN_NAME}`     | Your fully qualified domain domain, for example feedbacky.app.cool. |   |
| `{SERVER_IP}`       | The public IP address used by your hosting machine.                 |   |
| `{CLIENT_APP_PORT}` | The client port located in your `.env` file, by default it is 8090. |   |

You can now save the file with `CTRL` + `S` and exit nano with `CTRL` + `C`.

#### Creating a symlink

A symlink or symbolic link, is a shortcut to another file. Each time you will edit your VirtualHost in `/etc/nginx/sites-available` it will also update the one created in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`.

```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/{DOMAIN_NAME}.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/{DOMAIN_NAME}.conf
```

#### Enabling the VirtualHost

To enable your VirtualHost we must reload NGINX:

```
sudo service nginx reload
```

Finally, using the DNS provider of your choice, create an **A Record** that points to your machine's public IP adress and Apache will handle the for rest for you.

Voila 🎉, you just created a VirtualHost with NGINX for your Feedbacky instance!
